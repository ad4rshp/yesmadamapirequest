Integration into a Django Project:
To use this yes_madam_api app, integrate it into your existing or a new Django project:

Place the App:
Copy the entire yes_madam_api folder into your Django project's root directory (the same directory where your manage.py file is located, alongside your main project folder, e.g., myproject/).

Your project structure should look like this:

your_django_project_root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manage.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myproject/          # Your main Django project folder (contains settings.py)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ yes_madam_api/      # This app's folder
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

Add to INSTALLED_APPS:
Open your project's settings.py file (e.g., myproject/settings.py) and add 'yes_madam_api', 'rest_framework', and 'rest_framework.authtoken' to your INSTALLED_APPS list:

# myproject/settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... other Django default apps ...
    'rest_framework',
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
    'yes_madam_api', # Add your app here
]

# Crucial: Tell Django to use the custom User model from this app
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'yes_madam_api.User'

Include App URLs:
Open your project's main urls.py file (e.g., myproject/urls.py) and include the URLs from yes_madam_api:

# myproject/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    # Include all API endpoints from yes_madam_api under the '/api/' prefix
    path('api/', include('yes_madam_api.urls')),
]

Run Migrations:
Navigate to your project's root directory (where manage.py is) in your terminal and run the migrations. It's highly recommended to delete db.sqlite3 and the 00xx_*.py files in yes_madam_api/migrations/ (except __init__.py) before running these if this is a fresh integration, to avoid conflicts.

python manage.py makemigrations yes_madam_api
python manage.py migrate

Create a Superuser: (Optional, but recommended for admin access)

python manage.py createsuperuser
